Program Description

This program is a Weekly Budget Analyzer that allows users to enter their daily spending for seven days. The program stores the data in an array and analyzes it using object-oriented programming principles.

The WeeklyData class encapsulates the data and provides methods to calculate:

Total weekly spending

Average daily spending

Highest spending day

Lowest spending day

The App class handles user interaction. It:

Prompts the user to enter a weekly budget goal

Collects 7 days of spending data

Validates input to prevent negative values

Displays a full weekly summary

Provides feedback based on whether the user stayed within budget

This project demonstrates:

Array usage

Loop-based array algorithms

Encapsulation with private instance variables

Deep copying to avoid aliasing

Clean formatted output

Input validation using while loops
